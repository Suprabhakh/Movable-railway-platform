# Movable-railway-platform
This project improves pedestrian safety at railway crossings.
Sensors detect an approaching train and Arduino controls a motor
to move the platform to a safe position.

Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor
- Motor
- Motor Driver (L293D / L298N)

Firmware Concepts:
- Digital input from sensor
- GPIO control
- Motor direction control
- Safety-based decision logic

Status:
Code compiles successfully in Arduino IDE.
